{{ .Description | trimspace }}

AppDynamics drives business outcomes by putting application health in the context of your business, while providing unparalleled observability across tools, services and infrastructure on the backend.

The AppDynamicsCloud provider is used to interact with the [AppDynamics Cloud Platform](https://www.appdynamics.com/). It offers resources that make it possible to create and manage Cloud Connections, Configuration, Service Principals and querying all observation data using the Unified Query Language (UQL).

~> **Note:** Service Principals cannot be managed by the credentials
of another service principal. you need to sign in through your user credentials
by login mode browser or headless to use this resource.

~> **Note:** If you rotate and revoke secret at the same time, it will first perform
the revoke operation and then rotate it.

### Attribute Reference:

| Login Mode          | Required Attributes                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | 
| `service_principal` | `client_id`, `client_secret`         |
| `headless`          | `save_token`, `username`, `password` |
| `browser`           | `save_token`                         |

~> **Note:** Using the login mode browser requires the Chrome browser to be installed, and it should work on any OS with a desktop environment. You can use headless mode if your platform lacks a desktop environment. However, the 'google-chrome-stable' package must be installed. Depending on your operating system, you can install the package by following blog posts [like this](https://geekflare.com/install-chromium-ubuntu-centos/).
